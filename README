Dependencies:
The StockAccount will require two external dependencies to run correctly
- yahoofinance
- slf4j-simple

General Instructions:

To execute the full program, please ensure all classes are within the same directory, and run the main method from the
GUIMain class.

After running the main method from the GUIMain class, please first proceed as an administrator and type in a name
and a password to create a BankManager account. The admin code will be:I love jellies(with the spaces in between the words)

After doing so, you can log in as a bank manager to test out the bank manager interface.

Alternatively, sign up as a new user to send a request to open an account, and log in as a bank manager to approve the
account creation request. By default, a chequing account will be created along with the user account and the user can
request to create more types of account when logging in the next time.

If you wish to use the "Deposit money into your account" option, you must have an input file "deposits.txt" within the
same directory. Each deposit occupies one line and is represented in the format "cash, DEPOSIT_AMOUNT". A sample
deposits.txt is provided.

If you wish to withdraw, please enter an amount that is a multiple of 5 in order to receive the exact amount. This is
because only $50, $20, $10, and $5 bills exist in the atm machine.

File paths:
alerts.txt is in the Machine class constructor
deposits.txt and outgoing.txt is in the Account class constructor
requests.txt is in the initializer of the controller
